# Todo
- Use points instead of lines when rendering paths
- Swapout _lines with _line_colors - OR mesh together both vertex and line data together in one vbo
- Get velocity relative to one planet
- Check if mouse is in oval - can be done by checking if scale of x and y are different
- Optimize renderer by reusing vaos with the same vertex attribs. Bind multiple buffers to one vao instead.
- Change all color vec4s to vec3s

# Done
- Ability to add planets at runtime and position them as well -- done
- Click on planets to get info -- done
- Check if mouse is on circle -- done
- Trace predicted paths when stopped -- done
- circle rendering -- done
- Gravity object -- done
